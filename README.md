- EJS: For webpage templating
- Mongoose: As a driver to connect MongoDB with node.js

## What it does?

1. Upon visiting our web app the user is presented with a home Page where they can see basic details about charities, volunteers, fundraising and small shops.

2. Once the user click on any one of nav-icon they will be render to that page where they can see various posts related to charities, fundraising, shop small or volunteers depends on which icon they clicked and if they want to read more about it they will click on the read more button related to that post which will render them to that post page where they can see more  details about it.
On each post page whether it's related to charity or fundraising or shop we have provided details such as name, about, address, contact and image.
We have also provided social icons so that if they want other peoples to know about that charity or shop or fund, they can do this by sharing it on any of their social media which they want by clicking on that social icons on the given post page.
On the fundraising posts we have provided a feature to donate funds, so that if any user wants to donate funds they can do this by clicking on donate button on any of the fundraising post where they want to donate, and once they click on donate button they will be rendered to the donate page where they have to provide some basic details about donator and the amount which they want to pay.

3. The user will also get an option of **Add charity**, **Add shops** and **Fundraisers** through which they can publish their own posts regarding charity, shops, and funds on our site.

## How we built it ‚öôÔ∏è

For frontend, we had used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript. For backend, the real gem was to store data provided by user for which we had used MongoDB and Mongoose as a driver to connect MongoDB with node.JS. 

## Installation/Execution ‚úÖ

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate into the repo and run

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a file named `config.env` in the root directory of the project
4. Copy contents of `config.copy.env` to `config.env` and replace all the environment variables
5. To start the server run
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## Challenges we ran into üíª
1. Fetching and Installing Dependencies 
2. Fixing Backend Errors

## Accomplishments that we're proud of üèÜ

We were able to complete the idea behind the challenge and create a hack to solve the problems for local groups and small businesses. Team Work was something we were really proud of especially when we had errors we worked together to fix them.

## What we learnt? üìö

Teamwork makes the dream work!

## What's next for Support Local?

Building a complete full-stack web application and helping the user to experience the best out of it.
