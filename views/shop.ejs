          Charity, a noble quality in man, brings welfare in the society.
          It enlarges human hearts and spreads the message of brotherhood and innocent love among the people.
          The pracÂ­tice of charity was adored in ancient days. The saints and the sages lived on alms offered by the affluent people. It was then an accepted
          practice to give whatever was possible in charity for the welfare of the people and the society.
